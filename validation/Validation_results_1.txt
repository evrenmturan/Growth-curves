Results from Myhrvold 2013, Revisiting the Estimation of Dinosaur Growth Rates

Reported
=====================
Best Fit: Power 3
A = 3.397
B = 0.8576
13 = 13.11

Calculated
=====================
Best Fit: Power 3
a: 3.3+/-0.9
b: 0.86+/-0.08
c: 13.2+/-2.4

=> Same model is identified as best by AICc, same parameters are estimated (within the uncertainty bounds reported). Note that uncertainty estimates from Myhrvold (2013) were not reported.
