Results from Myhrvold 2013, Revisiting the Estimation of Dinosaur Growth Rates

Reported
=====================
Best Fit: Linear
A = 2.52
B = 6.95

Second Best Fit: Power (2)
A = 5.892
B = 0.749

Calculated
=====================
Best Fit: Linear
a: 2.52+/-0.17
b: 6.9+/-1.5

Second Best Fit: Power (2)
a: 5.9+/-0.8
b: 0.74+/-0.06


=> Same models are identified as best and second best by AICc, same parameters are estimated (within the uncertainty bounds reported). Note that uncertainty estimates from Myhrvold (2013) were not reported.
