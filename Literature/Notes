Dinosaur Growth

Most of the widely used models are sigmoidal (S shaped), these include the Gompertz, von Bertalanffy and logistic curves.

Another widely used family of models are attenuating curves such as the monomolecular (negative exponential) curve.

Although many studies feature exlusive asymptotic models there are exceptions. Power-law and linear... 

Choice of dependent variable

Kaufman 1981 - use size as independent variable
Myhrvold - many dinosaur models use age as independent 

Given that Model I regression assumes there is no error in the independent variable then the choice of independent variable should be in the more accurate measurement. 


Loss models
    soft_l1 = Smooth L1-loss
    Smooth L1-loss combines the advantages of L1-loss (steady gradients for large values of x) and L2-loss (less oscillations during updates when x is small).
