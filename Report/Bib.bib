abstract = {Scientific studies and population management may benefit from knowledge of the age structure of a target population. We evaluated traditional and newly developed methods of estimating the age of kangaroos with data from 336 western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) culled from a wild population in south-western Australia. We compared their ages based on molar progression with data on head, leg, and foot length, a balanced sum of all three measures, dried eye-lens weight, and molar wear score, and derived formulae to estimate age from each variable. Molar wear score has a linear relationship to molar progression and therefore leads to similar estimations of age, but requires only one complete arcade of molars. Because the relationships between age and the lengths of head, foot and leg are curvilinear, these become less reliable indicators of age with increasing age but the accuracy can be improved by considering a combination of the lengths of head, foot, and leg. Estimation of age from dried lens weight is more accurate than estimation from morphometry. The use of morphometry to estimate the age of kangaroos older than two years is more reliable than previously thought and requisite data can be collected from live animals. Where lethal methods are needed to collect samples, a largely intact skull, a single arcade of molars, or the lens extracted from one eye can reliably be used to estimate age.},

A total of 5274 monthly weight records from birth up to 180 days of age from 889 lambs, collected during 2001 to 2004 in Betecoucou breeding farm in Benin were used. In the preliminary analysis, the General Linear Model Procedure of the Statistical Analysis Systems Institute was applied to the dataset to identify the significant effects of the sex of lamb (male and female), type of birth (single and twin), season of birth (rainy season and dry season), parity of dam (1, 2 and 3) and year of birth (2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004) on the observed birth weight and monthly weight up to 6 months of age. The models parameters ( A , B and k ), coefficient of determination ( R 2 ), mean square error (MSE) were calculated using language of technical computing package Matlab {\textregistered} , 2006. The mean values of A , B and k were substituted into each model to calculate the corresponding Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). Among the four growth functions, the Brody model has been selected for its accuracy of fit according to the higher R 2 , lower MSE and AIC. Finally, the parameters A , B and k were adjusted in Matlab {\textregistered} , 2006 for the sex of lamb, year of birth, season of birth, birth type and the parity of ewe, providing a specific slope of the Brody growth curve. The results of this study suggest that Brody model can be useful for WAD sheep breeding in Betecoucou farm conditions through growth monitoring.},

The models used were: Von Bertalanffy, Brody, Gompertz and Logistic. The parameters were estimated by NLIN procedure and the criteria used to evaluate the adjustment given by the models were: asymptotic standard deviation; coefficient of determination; average absolute deviation of residues and asymptotic index. Von Bertalanffy and Brody models overestimated the male asymptotic weight (A) in 15.9 and 171.3kg, respectively, and the Gompertz and Logistic models underestimated it in 4.5 and 13.4kg, respectively. For females, the Logistic model underestimated the asymptotic weight (-2.09kg), and Gompertz, Von Bertalanffy and Brody overestimated this parameter in 8.04, 17.7, and 280.33kg, respectively. The biggest average deviation was estimated by Brody model for both sexes, characterizing the biggest index.

abstract = {Modelling the growth curves of animals is important for optimizing the management and efficiency of animal production; however, little is known about the growth curves in American mink (Neovison vison). The study evaluated the performances of four three-parameter (Logistic, Gompertz, von Bertalanffy, and Brody), four four-parameter (Richards, Weibull, Bridges, and Janoscheck) and two polynomial models for describing the growth curves in mink. Body weights were collected from the third week of life to the week 31 in 738 black mink (373 males and 365 females). Models were fitted using the nls and nlsLM functions in stats and minpack.lm packages in R software, respectively. The Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) were used for model comparison. Based on these criteria, Logistic and Richards were the best models for males and females, respectively. Four-parameter models had better performance compared to the other models except for Logistic model. The estimated maximum weight and mature growth rate varied among the models and differed between males and females. The results indicated that males and females had different growth curves as males grew faster and reached to the maximum body weight later compared to females. Further studies on genetic parameters and selection response for growth curve parameters are required for development of selection programs based on the shape of growth curves in mink.},

Analyses of variance of growth traits estimated by the four functions and of the residual mean squares (RMS) indicated that all differences between functions in estimated mature weight (A) were statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.01 to P {\textless} 0.0001) except for RCD vs. GMP (P {\textless} 0.27). Differences between functions in RMS were significant for RCD vs. LOG (P {\textless} 0.0026), MON vs. LOG (P {\textless} 0.0044) and GMP vs. LOG (P {\textless} 0.0584). RCD differed from all other functions in average lifetime growth rate (P {\textless} 0.1 to P {\textless} 0.0001) and from MON (P {\textless} 0.0004) and GMP (P {\textless} 0.0003) in average lifetime maturing rate.

abstract = {Feathers play a critical role in thermoregulation and directly influence poultry production. Poor feathering adversely affects living appearance and carcass quality, thus reducing profits. However, producers tend to ignore the importance of feather development and do not know the laws of feather growth and development. The objective of this study was to fit growth curves to describe the growth and development of feathers in yellow-feathered broilers during the embryonic and posthatching periods using different nonlinear functions (Gompertz, logistic and Bertalanffy). Feather mass and length were determined during the embryonic development and posthatching stages to identify which growth model most accurately described the feather growth pattern. The results showed that chick embryos began to grow feathers at approximately embryonic (E) day 10, and the feathers grew rapidly from E13 to E17. There was little change from E17 to the day of hatching (DOH) . During the embryonic period, the Gompertz function ( Y = 798.48e −203 431exp(−0.87 t ) , Akaike's information criterion ( AIC ) = −0.950 × 10 3 , Bayesian information criterion ( BIC ) = −0.711 × 10 3 and mean square error ( MSE ) = 559.308) provided the best fit for the feather growth curve compared with the other two functions. After hatching, feather mass and length changed little from the DOH to day (D) 14, increased rapidly from D21 to D91 and then grew slowly after D91. The first stage of feather molting occurred from 2 to 3 weeks of age when the down feathers were mostly shed and replaced with juvenile feathers, and the second stage occurred at approximately 13 to 15 weeks of age. The three nonlinear functions could overall fit the feather growth curve well, but the Bertalanffy model ( Y = 116.88 × (1−0.86e −0.02 t ) 3 , AIC = 1.065 × 10 5 , BIC = 1.077 × 10 5 and MSE = 11.308) showed the highest degree of fit among the models. Therefore, the Gompertz model exhibited the best goodness of fit for the feather growth curve during the embryonic development, while the Bertalanffy model was the most suitable model due to its accurate ability to predict the growth and development of feathers during the growth period, which is an important commercial characteristic of yellow-feathered chickens.},
